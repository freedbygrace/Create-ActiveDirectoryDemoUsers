# Create-ActiveDirectoryDemoUsers
Ever had to create a test domain environment, but got stuck creating user accounts and groups to test with? Have you ever needed to create user accounts with rich actionable Active Directory attributes so you emulate scenarios you would see in production environments? If you have, then this script will handle that for you. You can run this on a test domain with an authorized account, and it will create up to 2000 users with rich attribute details, and an organizational unit structure to match. The OU structure is broken up by Country and State, and each user will get an EmployeeID, Address, City, State, Department, Title, and be added to a group with their department members. This should allow for more rich testing scenarios to better serve customers and places of work. Have Fun!
